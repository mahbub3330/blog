## Blog Site Features

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- Admin Panel where admin can.
- Author Panel where author can upload and manipulate post. Also can see overall activites and feedback On his/her own dashboard.
- Users can throw comment, can mark a post as his/her favourite also can see how many times post has been seen.
- Users can Subscribe our blog by which they can get notification for new posts.
- Can search post By their interested categories.

This is all basic features that make the site simple and user-friendly.
