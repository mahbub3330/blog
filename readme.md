## Blog Site Features

This site is developed to learn and improve my laravel concept for myself. I added some basic and important features like

- Admin Panel where admin can control all access also manipulate all authors as well their posts,subscribers,comments.  On his dashboard there is an overview and analysis of overall activites where he can see total posts, favorite posts, pending posts, total views,number of categories, tags, author and also new registered author. However there is also  analytical result of top 5  popular posts as well top 5 authors list. 
- Author Panel where author can upload and manipulate post. He can see overall activites and feedback also top posts that is liked by users on his/her own dashboard. 
- Users can throw comment, can mark a post as his/her favourite also can see how many times post has been seen.
- Users can Subscribe our blog by which they can get notification for new posts.
- Can search post By their interested categories.

This is all basic features that make the site simple and user-friendly.
